description: "Ulaam spiral caught my eye after seeing it for the first time on YouTube shorts. Whole nature of primes fascinated my right after my first class in Discrete mathematics. After I started implementing visual mathematical structures in TS to be displayed in browser, I knew I have to implement some sort of Ulaam spiral generator. It was hard to decide, if I want to go with small dots and less readability or bigger ones and less num coverage. I decided for a compromise scaling the size of dots down with more numbers to draw."
