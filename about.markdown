Greetings, my name is Jakub and I work as a software develper and I'm student of applied mathematics in economy with specialization in linear optimalizations. 

Linear optimalizations have quite close to computer science and I love connecting these fields together in my free time projects and coding experiments.

As a software developer I enjoy both programming, systems design, architecture and modelling. I regulary take different courses to expand my knowledge in the field and to stay up to date with new trends. 

My hobbies outside of informatics/mathematics include photography, playing the guitar and sitting in an armchair and drinking coffee while watching some movie.
