title: "Monte Carlo simulations for statistic laws"
date: 2024-04-26
url: https://github.com/jakvitov/math_simulations
description: "This repository is rather messy, filled with Monte Carlo simulations, that I usually make to test some statistics laws and better understand something taught at university. Most of the Jupyter and Julia notebooks are in Czech, since it's my mother thoungue, in which I am taught. As time goes on, new simulations are added here."
