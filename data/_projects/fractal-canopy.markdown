description: "Fractal canopy generator made with Typescript is one of my most enjoyable projects I've created. Whole rendering is pixel by pixel implemented on HTML canvas like in my other browser oriented compsci/math interesting algorithm implementations. You can download the release zip and fire it up in your browser and mess with it!"
